# Responsive-Registration-Form-To-Do-List-Web-App
Built a fully responsive web app using HTML, CSS (Flexbox &amp; Grid), and JavaScript. Features include a stylish registration form with real-time validation, a mobile-friendly responsive layout, and an interactive to-do list allowing users to add and delete tasks dynamically with instant updates.
1. Contact Form Using HTML and CSS
  A well-styled form with:
  Text input for name
  Email input for email address
  A submit button

3. JavaScript Form Validation
  When you try to submit the form:
  If required fields are empty or email format is wrong, a message displays and the form does not submit.
  Valid submissions can give a "Thank you" prompt.

4. Responsive Layout Using Flexbox and CSS Grid
  The navigation bar is built with Flexbox and adapts to different screen sizes (menus stack vertically on small screens).
  Main content (including the form) is placed in a CSS Grid that rearranges itself for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  Media queries apply different styles based on device width.

5. Dynamic To-Do List or Image Gallery Using JavaScript
  A section allows you to enter a task or upload an image.
  Each new item appears instantly (no page reload).
  You can remove tasks or images dynamically by clicking a "delete" button next to them.
